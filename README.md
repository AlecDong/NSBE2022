## CONNECT 4 COMMUNITY WEBSITE PROJECT

Connect 4 Community (Connect) is an online support platform in which members may create a profile and share their experiences with other individuals going through similar troubles. Individuals may also view otherâ€™s posts and reply with their own ideas, engaging in meaningful discussion. Whether it be stories, experiences, or issues they face, Connect hopes to establish a welcoming and inclusive community in which people can share the burden and find support to spread positivity.

The website, constructed using a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, and other tools, has functionality for an individual to both create posts under an individual's name as well as read various posts created by other users.

To test the website, clone this repository and install the following packages: 
  - **Flask 1.1.2**
  - **Flask-Session 0.4.0**
  - **SQLite 3.35.5**

Then, open the folder directory in a terminal/command prompt and type **"flask run"** to run the website!
