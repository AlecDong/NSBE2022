# CONNECT 4 COMMUNITY WEBSITE PROJECT

Connect 4 Community (Connect) is an online support platform in which members may create a profile and share their experiences with other individuals going through similar troubles. Individuals may also view otherâ€™s posts and reply with their own ideas, engaging in meaningful discussion. Whether it be stories, experiences, or issues they face, Connect hopes to establish a welcoming and inclusive community in which people can share the burden and find support to spread positivity.
